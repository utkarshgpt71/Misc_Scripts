The python script bits_in_W.py finds bit-level variables
in terms of the the word-level variable for the given 
representation:

W = m0 + m_1*x + m_2*x^2 + ... + m_{n-1}*x^{n-1}

where x is the primitive element of the field
F_{2^n} and the primitive polynomial selected from 
bprimitive file.

The output is stored as comma separated word-level 
representaions of m_0, m_1, ..., m_{k-1} in a 
file Computed_Lists/bits_in_W_n_k.list,
where n and k are provided as input arguments to the 
python script as follows:

python bits_in_W.py n k

n: n denotes the field F_{2^n}
k: k-1 is the last bit for which word-level
   representation is computed starting from 
   m_0, m_1, ..., m_{k-1}

Notes:
1. The following asseration should not fail:
					k <= n
